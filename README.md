# `XMLHttpRequest` for Node.js

üåê `XMLHttpRequest` polyfill that supports sync requests \
üí° Inspired by [driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest]

üìú [Mostly spec-compliant] \
‚è± Supports synchronous requests \
üå≤ Delegates to `DOMParser()` for XML parsing

## Installation

This package is intended solely for Node.js. You can use install it from npm:

```sh
npm install @jcbhmr/xhr
```

## Usage

üõë You **cannot** use this package in the browser! Make sure you conditionally
import it!

```js
if (typeof process !== "undefined") {
  await import("@jcbhmr/xhr");
}
```

After importing the polyfill, you can use the global `XMLHttpRequest` and
related interfaces as normal.

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.responseText);
});
xhr.open("GET", "http://example.org/");
xhr.send();
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This polyfill **does** support synchronous network operations. Be careful
though! You don't want to cause your Node.js HTTP server to freeze while making
a synchronous HTTP request!

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "http://example.org/", false);
xhr.send();
console.log(xhr.responseText);
```

‚Ñπ Just like most major browsers, this **will print a warning message**.

### XML parsing

**We don't include XML parsing by default.** If there is an exposed
`DOMParser()` class in the global scope, this package will use that to parse the
response. If this is unavailable, then all of the XML-related operations will
throw.

For example, this will work:

```js
import { JSDOM } from "jsdom";

const { window } = new JSDOM();
globalThis.DOMParser = window.DOMParser;

const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.responseType = "document";
xhr.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.responseXML);
});
xhr.open("GET", "http://example.org/");
xhr.send();
```

But if there's no `DOMParser()` polyfill, then the `xhr.responseType` setter
will throw.

### XML serialization

When sending a request that is an `instanceof Document`, we will delegate to the
native `XMLSerializer()` if it exists. If not, this will throw an error. Note
that the `Document` class is also required for the `instanceof` check.

For example, this works:

```js
import { JSDOM } from "jsdom";

const { window } = new JSDOM();
globalThis.Document = window.Document;
globalThis.XMLSerializer = window.XMLSerializer;

const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.responseXML);
});
xhr.open("POST", "http://example.org/");
xhr.send(window.document);
```

# node-XMLHttpRequest #

Fork of [node-XMLHttpRequest](https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest) by [driverdan](http://driverdan.com). Forked and published to npm because a [pull request](https://github.com/rase-/node-XMLHttpRequest/commit/a6b6f296e0a8278165c2d0270d9840b54d5eeadd) is not being created and merged. Changes made by [rase-](https://github.com/rase-/node-XMLHttpRequest/tree/add/ssl-support) are needed for [engine.io-client](https://github.com/Automattic/engine.io-client).

## Usage ##

Here's how to include the module in your project and use as the browser-based
XHR object.

	var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest-ssl").XMLHttpRequest;
	var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

Note: use the lowercase string "xmlhttprequest-ssl" in your require(). On
case-sensitive systems (eg Linux) using uppercase letters won't work.

## Versions ##

Version 2.0.0 introduces a potentially breaking change concerning local file system requests.
If these requests fail this library now returns the `errno` (or -1) as the response status code instead of
returning status code 0.

Prior to 1.4.0 version numbers were arbitrary. From 1.4.0 on they conform to
the standard major.minor.bugfix. 1.x shouldn't necessarily be considered
stable just because it's above 0.x.

Since the XMLHttpRequest API is stable this library's API is stable as
well. Major version numbers indicate significant core code changes.
Minor versions indicate minor core code changes or better conformity to
the W3C spec.

## Supports ##

* Async and synchronous requests
* GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
* All spec methods (open, send, abort, getRequestHeader,
  getAllRequestHeaders, event methods)
* Requests to all domains

## Known Issues / Missing Features ##

For a list of open issues or to report your own visit the [github issues
page](https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest/issues).

* Local file access may have unexpected results for non-UTF8 files
* Synchronous requests don't set headers properly
* Synchronous requests freeze node while waiting for response (But that's what you want, right? Stick with async!).
* Some events are missing, such as abort
* getRequestHeader is case-sensitive
* Cookies aren't persisted between requests
* Missing XML support
* Missing basic auth
